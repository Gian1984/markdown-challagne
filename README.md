### You can always count on me when... 
When someone need a smile, or talk about his personal problem .... 
And too when it's work prob, i can try to do my best.

### A funny story 
I was sit down to enjoy a hot cup of coffee, then my boss ask me to do something that will last until the coffee is cold. 

### TL;DR
If you want to do it something, do it now!
